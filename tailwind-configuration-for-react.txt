Tailwind configuration for React app:

After creating your react app

1) npm i -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer. (saved as dev dependencies).

2) npx tailwind init tailwind.js --full (initialise tailwind and create a tailwind.js file which has all the 
configurations that tailwind has which is screensize, colors, boarders etc in project folder(where the package.json files are)

3) create a postcss.config.js file and in the file, paste the following: 

const tailwindcss = require('tailwindcss');
module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        tailwindcss('./tailwind.js'),
        require('autoprefixer')
    ],
};

4) in src folder create a folder called assets

5) in assets create two files:

tailwind.css
main.css

6) in tailwind.css write/ import the following:

@tailwind base;

@tailwind components;

@tailwind utilities;

...this basically compiles into the main.css which we use in our react app


7) in package.json file, your script file should look like this:

"scripts": {
  "start": "npm run watch:css && react-scripts start",
  "build": "npm run build:css && react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject",
  "build:css": "postcss src/assets/tailwind.css -o src/assets/main.css",
  "watch:css": "postcss src/assets/tailwind.css -o src/assets/main.css"
}


8)run npm start 

...this generates all the tailwind classes into the main.css file. 
After running npm start you should be able to see all the base, components and utilities from tailwind inside your main.css file. 
React app should also start on the server as usual

9)inside your index.js file in your src folder, change the css-file import to: import './assets/main.css';
